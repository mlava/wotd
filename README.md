Expand your vocabulary by importing a Word of the Day with its definition to your graph.

**Update:**
The API used for this extension previously appears to be broken. The extension is now updated to use a new API, for which you will need a new API key.
The new API only imports one word. You can trigger it using Command Palette 'Word of the Day' or SmartBlock <%WOTD%>
Please get an API key from https://rapidapi.com/Edsonmark13/api/words-api5.

Below information kept for posterity, or in case the other API is restored...


There are two sources - Dictionary.com and Merriam Webster. You can choose to import one or both.
