Expand your vocabulary by importing a Word of the Day with its definition to your graph.

**Update:**

The API used for this extension previously appears to be broken. The extension is now updated to use a new API, for which you will need a new API key.

The new API only imports one word. You can trigger it using Command Palette 'Word of the Day' or SmartBlock <%WOTD%>.

Please get an API key from https://rapidapi.com/Edsonmark13/api/words-api5.
